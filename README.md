  * `scripts/app.js`
  * `scripts/controllers.js`
  * If you use yeoman than build your files (`gulp build`) and commit your dist directory to your completed repo.
  * Your repo should use .gitignore to remove bower_components

### Requirements

* No JSHint warnings or errors (other than ones related to angular)


## Normal Mode
Using the tools you've learned in class, create a sortable, filterable table of US states. The table should look and behave like the example below including showing and hiding arrows on the table headings indicating which direction the table is currently being sorted (and on which column). You should be able to type into the filter box and only show states that match the filter string on either the state name or abbreviation. Filtering on "tx" and "te" should both show Texas. The filtering should be case insensitive (both upper and lower case filter strings should work).
